# Profitability Optimization & Hidden Revenue Analysis  
### Retail Analytics Case Study

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on uncovering hidden profit leaks within a retail business that appeared financially strong on the surface.  
Despite healthy topline performance, deeper analysis revealed structural risks and missed revenue opportunities.

The objective was to move beyond surface-level KPIs and identify **where profit was truly generated — and where it was quietly leaking**.

---

## 📊 Business Snapshot
- **Total Sales:** $9.7M  
- **Reported Profit Margin:** 17%

While these numbers indicated stability, they raised an important question:

> *Are we optimized — or leaving money on the table?*

## ⚠️ Key Business Challenges Identified

### 1️⃣ Customer Concentration Risk
- **61% of revenue** came from large deals  
- **Top 5 customers contributed 25% of total sales**  

Heavy dependence on a small customer base exposed the business to high revenue risk.

---

### 2️⃣ Regional Profitability Gaps
- **APAC:** 51% of customers but relatively low profit margins  
- **North America:** Fewer customers with significantly higher profitability  

Customer volume did not directly translate into profit contribution.

---

### 3️⃣ Product Portfolio Imbalance
- **Classic Cars** accounted for **39% of total sales**  
- **Trains** contributed only **2%**  

Over-reliance on a single product category increased business risk and limited growth diversity.

---

### 4️⃣ Underutilized Weekend Revenue
- Only **8% of revenue** was generated during weekends  

This highlighted **over $1M in untapped revenue potential**.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

To address these issues, I applied a structured, business-driven analytics approach:

- Profitability analysis by **customer, product, region, and time**  
- Identification of **cost-to-serve differences** and margin gaps  
- Development of an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for leadership visibility  
- Translation of insights into **clear, actionable strategies**

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations
- Reduce dependency on high-risk customer concentration  
- Shift focus toward higher-margin regions  
- Diversify the product mix to balance revenue streams  
- Optimize marketing and sales efforts to unlock weekend demand

## 🚀 Business Impact
- **Profit margin potential increased from ~18% to 22–25%**  
- Leadership gained clarity on true profit drivers  
- Faster, data-backed decision-mak
